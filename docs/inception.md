# Clone - HaveIBeenPawned

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Objective

"I want to host information of breached data and provide a convenient interface for accessing information in a structured manner to the client."

- Client is the end-user who wants to check whether their information is breached.
- Here, breach means any information of the user like email, phone number, address, etc. that are stolen & made public in a security incident.

  
I want to build a platform-clone, much like HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP), that allows users to check if their email addresses or phone numbers have been exposed in publicly known data breaches. If a user finds their email or phone number on the site, it means that it was part of a database that was compromised in a past security incident.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è How Data Is Collected

The service like HIBP, collects and analyzes hundreds of database dumps and pastes containing information about billions of leaked accounts, and allows users to search for their own information by entering their username or email address. Hence, HIBP does not own the data itself but rather depend on public sources which are often reliable and verifiable. I will follow same model while building the clone.  


## ‚≠êÔ∏è Meaning of "Pwned"

The term has been adopted in the context of online security and refers to a situation where a user's account or system has been compromised. This could involve unauthorized access to an email account, a social media profile, or any other online service

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Learning Scope

This is entirely for learning. Following are the potential system-design aspects I am expecting to learn from this.

#### 1\. **Large Data Organization & Storage**

- Designing data schemas to efficiently store millions of records (e.g., email, phone, breach metadata).
- Evaluating trade-offs between SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) vs NoSQL (e.g., ElasticSearch, MongoDB) for search-heavy use cases.
- Understanding normalization vs denormalization in the context of breach records.

#### 2\. **Search & Indexing (Fast Lookup)**

- Implementing search functionality for fast querying by email or phone.
- Use of search engines (e.g., ElasticSearch) for full-text and keyword search.
- Indexing strategies to optimize performance on frequent queries.

#### 3\. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

- Learning to separate read and write operations:
    - Write side: Admin ingestion of breach data.
    - Read side: End-user querying/checking breaches.

- Understanding how to keep read models updated asynchronously (eventual consistency).

#### 4\. **Caching Strategies**

- Caching frequent queries using Redis or similar in-memory stores.
- Preventing backend overload with aggressive caching of non-sensitive and high-traffic pages (e.g., breach details, known breaches list).
- Using CDN to cache static pages and rate-limiting abusive requests.

#### 5\. **Security Best Practices**

- Secure input handling (e.g., to prevent enumeration attacks).
- Hashing and k-anonymity for privacy-preserving lookup (e.g., like HIBP's k-anonymity model with SHA-1 prefix matching).
- Rate limiting and abuse detection to prevent automated data scraping.

#### 6\. **Admin Data Management**

- Admin dashboard to upload breach dumps, validate data format, and process entries.
- Background jobs for data ingestion and indexing.
- Tagging metadata like breach source, date, affected services, and data types.

#### 7\. **API Design**

- RESTful or GraphQL APIs for client-side interaction.
- Public-facing APIs with throttling and API keys.
- Internal APIs for admin data ingestion.

#### 8\. **Scalability & Load Handling**

- Strategies for horizontal scaling of read replicas.
- Load balancing and auto-scaling policies on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS/GCP).
- Estimating query volumes and designing the system to scale accordingly.

#### 9\. **User Privacy & Ethics**

- Privacy-preserving designs to ensure users are not identifiable by others.
- Educating users without scaring them‚Äîstriking a balance between transparency and security awareness.

#### 10\. **Deployment & Monitoring**

- Containerization using Docker, deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel).
- Logging, metrics, and uptime monitoring.
- Using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for observability.
